# NLP-driven-Customer-Review-Analysis-with-Rating-Classification
This repository contains code for a data science project aimed at improving customer satisfaction in the airline industry. The project focuses on analyzing and understanding customer feedback from individual reviews using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Key Features:

Data Processing and Cleaning: Utilized Python for data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, and standardization to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Engineered new features to enhance the predictive power of the models, using domain knowledge and statistical methods.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand dataset characteristics, including feature distribution, outlier identification, and variable relationships.
Text Preprocessing: Processed textual data using NLP techniques such as removing stopwords, tokenization, and lemmatization to prepare text for analysis.
Feature Selection: Employed feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, and feature importance to identify relevant features for modeling.
Machine Learning Modeling: Developed and evaluated machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier) to predict customer recommendations. Implemented cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical form for machine learning models. Used sentiment analysis and topic modeling to extract insights from textual data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Utilized confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess model performance.
Business Impact: The project aims to address the business problem of improving customer satisfaction in the airline industry. By developing a classification model to categorize customer reviews based on sentiment and other relevant factors, the model provides actionable insights to airlines for enhancing the overall travel experience.
Communication and Visualization: Effectively communicated insights and findings to stakeholders using data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Presented results in a clear and understandable manner to drive business decisions.

Objective: To develop a classification model that can automatically categorize customer reviews based on sentiment and other relevant factors, enabling airlines to quickly identify areas of improvement, prioritize customer-centric initiatives, and enhance the overall travel experience.
